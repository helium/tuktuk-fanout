# Structure

Anchor code should be organized into the structure of the following:

- src
  - lib.rs
  - instructions
    - mod.rs
    - some_instruction_v0.rs
  - error.rs
  - state.rs

You can see an example endpoint at [initialize_account_windowed_breaker_v0.rs](mdc:programs/circuit-breaker/src/instructions/initialize_account_windowed_breaker_v0.rs)

All instructions should have a versioned Args struct, versions accounts context, and a handler. They should then be included in lib.rs similar to [lib.rs](mdc:programs/circuit-breaker/src/lib.rs)

# Accounts Validation

All accounts that can be verified via has_one should be verified by has_one. Any account present in the seeds = [...] should _not_ be verified via has_one.

# Token Accounts

All token accounts should be init_if_needed as associated token accounts via associated_token::mint and associated_token::owner
